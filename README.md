This contract library enables EVM contract creation in a similar way to CREATE2, but without including the contract `initCode` on the address derivation formula. It can be used to generate deterministic contract addresses that aren't tied to a specific contract code.

[EIP-3171](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/3171) aims to implement this funcionality natively, in the meantime this library should emulate the same behavior with a small cost overhead.

### Features

- Deterministic contract address based on `msg.sender` + salt
- Same contract addresses on different EVM networks
- Lightweight and without clutter
- Supports any EVM compatible chain with support for CREATE2
- Payable contract creation (forwarded to child contract)
- Constructors supported
- Standard contract init code (aka, Etherscan verification supported)

### Limitations

- More expensive than CREATE or CREATE2 (Fixed extra cost of ~55k gas)

## Usage

Call the `create3` method on the `Create3` library, provide the contract `creationCode` and a salt. Different contract codes will result on the same address as long as the same salt is provided.

### Install

`yarn add https://github.com/0xsequence/create3`

or

`npm install --save https://github.com/0xsequence/create3`

### Contract example

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@0xsequence/create3/contracts/Create3.sol";


contract Child {
  function hola() external view returns (string) {
    return "mundo";
  }
}

contract Deployer {
  function deployChild() external {
    Create3.create3(keccak256(bytes("<my salt>")), type(Child).creationCode);
  }
}
```
Example with constructor arguments:
```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@0xsequence/create3/contracts/Create3.sol";


contract Child {
  uint256 meaningOfLife;
  address owner;
  
  constructor(uint256 _meaning, address _owner) {
    meaningOfLife = _meaning;
    owner = _owner;
  }
}

contract Deployer {
  function deployChild() external {
    Create3.create3(
      keccak256(bytes("<my salt>")), 
      abi.encodePacked(
        type(Child).creationCode,
        abi.encode(
          42,
          msg.sender
        )
      )
    );
  }
}
```
